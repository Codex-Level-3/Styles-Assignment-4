# Styles Assignment 4

## Objective

Create a simple, yet elegant recipe webpage utilizing Tailwind CSS for layout and styling. This assignment focuses on building a user-friendly interface with card elements to display recipes, aiming to develop your skills in responsive web design and the integration of CSS frameworks.

## Kitchen Chronicles Recipe Webpage

## Project Structure - Components

### Dashboard.jsx

This component renders a collection of recipe cards using the `RecipeCards` component.

### RecipeCards.jsx

Displays individual recipe details including the recipe name, description, category, cooking time, and calories. The component utilizes Framer Motion for hover effects.

### Footer.jsx

Displays a footer with copyright information and a link to the creator's GitHub profile.

### Hero.jsx

A hero section with a background image, welcoming message, and a call-to-action button.

### NavigationBar.jsx

A navigation bar at the top of the page for easy navigation between different sections of the webpage.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
